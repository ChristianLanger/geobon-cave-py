# geobon-cave-py

Just a litte sunday pastime with python...<br>
This is a very simple text-adventure game based on the text-adventure Zork "The Great Underground Empire" from the beginning of the classic 80s. 

Just basic text-adventure without any fancy graphics. Via the keyboard the user types commands and navigates through the rooms and solves some puzzles.

## Getting Started

Run your terminal after installing python3 with

```
python3 geobon_cave.py

```
